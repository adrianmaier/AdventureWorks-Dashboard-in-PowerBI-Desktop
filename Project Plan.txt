#### Project Plan with Objectives ####

Key Objectives to build the Adventure Works Dashboard in Power BI Desktop

Chapters: 
- Connect and Shape Data for AdventureWorks 
- Create the Data Model (relational)
- Calculate Measures with DAX
- Visualize Data on Dashboard (interactive report)
- Optimize Performance



# Tasks: 

DATA CLEANSING

- Verify column headers and all data types are correct
- Replace zeros in the product style field with “NA”
- etc.


NUMERICALS 
Calculate
- Average product costs
- Number of product colors
- Distinct customers
- Max. annual customer income


CALENDAR DATES

- Month Name (e.g. “April”)
- Month Number (e.g. “4”)
- Start of Year (e.g. “1/1/2022”)
- Year (e.g. “2022”)


RELATIONSHIPS

- Create relationships (star schema) between Customer, Sales, Product, Calendar, Territories tables
- Connect all product tables (Product, Category, Subcategory) in a snowflake schema


HIERARCHIES

- Create a new hierarchy "Date Hierarchy" based on the start of year field
- Include in it:
1. Start of Year
2. Start of Month
3. Start of Week
4. Date

CREATE MEASURES FOR DASHBOARD

- math + stats measure
> Total Customers: the number of distinct customers 
> Create a measure named Return Rate: quant. returned divided by quant. sold

- logical 
> Create a calc. col. in the customer lookup  
- Customer Priority:
- Income Level


MEASURE CALCULATIONS AND INSIGHTS

Create:
- measure "Bike Returns": total quantity of bikes returned
- matrix to show Bike Returns (values) by Start of Month (rows)
- measure named Bike Sales: total quantity of bikes sold
- measure named Bike Return Rate
-> How to reply to any concerns about increasing bike returns?

- measure named All Returns: total amount of returns, disregarding filter context
- measure named % of All Returns that divides Total Returns by All Returns
- matrix to show % of All Returns by product Category Name
-> Which category shows largest + smallest return percentage?

- measure named Total Cost: multiplies the order quantities (Sales Data) by the product cost (Product Lookup), calculates the sum
- new measure named Total Profit (revenue - cost)
- matrix to show Total Profit (values) by Year (in rows)
-> How much profit has AdventureWorks generated in FY 2022?


- Previous Month Profit
- Previous Month Orders
- Previous Month Returns
- Order Target (as 10% inc. over previous period)
- Profit Target (as 10% inc. over previous period)


VIZ STRUCTURE

- card “UNIQUE CUSTOMERS”
- second card: Average Revenue per Customer
- added a line chart to the Customer Detail report with Total Customers (by week)
- added a table to the Customer Detail report with Customer Key, Name, Total Orders, Total Revenue
- used conditional formatting for the table rows
- added a visual-level filter (Top N) showing top 100 customers with most orders
- customer detail report: updated X-axis of line chart pulling in "Date Hierarchy"
- used chart header to drill up and down to see trends at each granularity
- tested drill mode to verify granularity
-> What is the reason some weeks look fairly low?

- Report interactions logic on the Customer Detail tab: 
filtering line chart not impacting donut charts, filtering table not impacting line chart and donuts, slicer should impact all visuals on the report page
